# Bayesian Risk Lab
A practical Bayesian lab focused on decision-oriented inference under uncertainty, with sparse and imperfect data.

My goal with this lab is to explore how uncertainty should be modelled, interpreted, and communicated when data is noisy, aggregated, incomplete, or scarce — and how this uncertainty impacts real-world decision-making.

This repository is intentionally practice-oriented: the emphasis is not on theoretical novelty, but on robustness, interpretability, and decision relevance.

## Scope and themes

The lab focuses on problems where naive statistical summaries or point estimates are misleading, including:

- Bayesian inference with sparse, noisy, or aggregated data
- Hierarchical modeling for territorial or multi-group comparisons
- Uncertainty-aware interpretation of rates, trends, and indicators
- Temporal risk, changepoints, and instability in time series
- Decision-oriented visualizations of uncertainty (maps, intervals, probabilities)

Typical application domains include public health, population-level indicators, and other systems where decisions must be made under imperfect information.

## Repository structure

This repository is organized as a lab rather than a single project.
